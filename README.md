# 🧠 Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways 🚀

A Generative AI-powered platform that creates and adapts personalized learning journeys for students — tailored to their goals, skills, and learning style.  
Built for students, educators, and EdTech innovators seeking scalable, intelligent course guidance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement :

> **“Design an agentic AI system that generates personalized educational roadmaps using LLMs.”**

---

## ✅ Why This Project Stands Out

### 1. 🤖 Strong Use of Generative AI
- Uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to understand:
  - Student goals (e.g., become a full-stack dev)
  - Skill levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
  - Learning preferences (videos, hands-on, text-based)
- **Dynamically adapts** pathways as students progress.
- Integrates with:
  - 📚 GenAI summarizers
  - 📌 Recommenders
  - ❓ AI-generated quiz/question banks

### 2. 🎓 High Educational Impact
- Helps tackle:
  - ❗ Curriculum overload
  - ❓ Unclear career directions
  - 🧩 One-size-fits-all learning models
- Builds **confidence and clarity** for learners.

### 3. 🌐 Scalable & Flexible
- Works across:
  - Universities & colleges
  - MOOCs & online platforms
  - Career counseling apps
- Supports **multilingual learning** with localized GenAI content.

### 4. 🧪 Real-World Viability
- 🎯 EdTech is a booming GenAI use case.
- Schools & companies want **AI-based learning assistants**.
- Can integrate with existing LMS like:
  - Moodle
  - Google Classroom
  - Canvas

### 5. 🛠️ Easy to Extend
Includes support for:
- 🤖 GPT-powered doubt clearing assistant
- 🧩 Prerequisite tree generation
- 💡 AI-generated project & capstone ideas

## 💡 Bonus Innovations

- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to access real-time online learning content
- 🗺️ “Chat with your curriculum” chatbot
- 📈 Visualize learning paths with graph-based interfaces
